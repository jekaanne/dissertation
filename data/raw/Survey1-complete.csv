Set the system up w/out correct parameters. Snow storm in one neighborhood, buses run late/have issues, and buses are sent too far (north to south) but it takes too long. When drivers are running late and explain, they get ostracized.   Thankful for service, but it could be improved and made better. Management doesn't listen. Challenged to ride the service for a week, said they can't take paratransit. 3/4 mile rule - State legislature is trying to expand it. Affected by 3/4 mile rule. Monday - Friday, transportation is decent. Saturday and Sunday, since I live past 3/4 mile boundary, can't get paratransit (homebound). Dispatcher gave information of where to go to get picked up. Rules have room to wiggle, may be enforced differently. 5 minute pick up rule. Sometimes they'll wait up to 25 minutes for someone, need equal application of the rules.   People overhelp, don't know how to help. If you don't guide them to what you need, like telling people how to guide a nonsighted person (be in front, use shoulder, for example). Trying to get information is vague, transferring always needs assistance and direction. Fixed route drivers are very helpful, some even insisted on assisting in crossing street. When drivers do a good job, I give commendations. Bus station and train station layouts are not friendly for people with low vision or physical disabilities.  Uber and Lyft have program called """"""""Go Go Grandparent"""""""" - concierge service to book uber or lyft.  Air travel is good, have never had issue.
